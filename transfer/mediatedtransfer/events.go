/*
EventSendRevealSecret Sends a RevealSecret to another node.

    This event is used once the secret is known locally and an action must be
    performed on the receiver:

        - For receivers in the payee role, it informs the node that the lock has
            been released and the token can be withdrawn, either on-chain or
            off-chain.
        - For receivers in the payer role, it tells the payer that the payee
            knows the secret and wants to withdraw the lock off-chain, so the payer
            may unlock the lock and send an up-to-date balance proof to the payee,
            avoiding on-chain payments which would require the channel to be
            closed.

    For any mediated transfer:

        - The initiator will only perform the payer role.
        - The target will only perform the payee role.
        - The mediators will have `n` channels at the payee role and `n` at the
          payer role, where `n` is equal to `1 + number_of_refunds`.

    Note:
        The payee must only update its local balance once the payer sends an
        up-to-date balance-proof message. This is a requirement for keeping the
        nodes synchronized. The reveal secret message flows from the receiver
        to the sender, so when the secret is learned it is not yet time to
        update the balance.

EventSendBalanceProof send a balance-proof to the counter-party, used after a lock

    Used by payers: The initiator and mediator nodes.

    Note:
        This event has a dual role, it serves as a synchronization and as
        balance-proof for the netting channel smart contract.

        Nodes need to keep the last known merkle root synchronized. This is
        required by the receiving end of a transfer in order to properly
        validate. The rule is "only the party that owns the current payment
        channel may change it" (remember that a netting channel is composed of
        two uni-directional channels), as a consequence the merkle root is only
        updated by the receiver once a balance proof message is received.
